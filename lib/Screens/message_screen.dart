We all face the ups and downs in our lives. But what defines us is the way we pull ourselves out of those situations. And boy I must say, what better example to give than yours. I have seen your will to fight in every tough situation. May it be our college examinations or may it be your life. You have always given the toughest of fights to every situation. I sincerely feel very proud of you when I think of all the situations you have gone through and the way you have punched them hard in the face. Staying away from your childhood friends, staying away from Baba for months are just among those instances that have proven that you have a heart of steel. You have always shown that a person who is so tough in her life can also be as soft and comforting at the same time...\nI have never ever felt any hesitation in calling you a FIGHTER.\n\nKeep fighting my friend...\nKeep fighting...\nWish you all the best for your future endeavours and may you achieve everything that you always have wanted to achieve...\nMay God be with you and wish you God Speed :")', 'image_url': 'assets/images/Varad.jpeg'},
